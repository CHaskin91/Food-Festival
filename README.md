# Food-Festival

A web application for an upcoming food event.

## Lesson 1

- Identified potential bottlenecks and large, unoptimized files using the Network tab of the browser.
- Audited application performance using Google's Lighthouse tool.
- Minified JavaScript files.
- Minified Image files.
- Lazy-loaded JavaScript files.

## Lesson 2

- Use the command line to run the build.
- Bundle the JavaScript files in an automated approach to code minification.
- Modify the `webpack.config` file to configure output, plugins for vendor code, and set the mode.
- Use webpack dependency graphs to keep track of needed bundles for each entry point.

## Lesson 3

- Code splitting bundles of JavaScript files to reduce the page-load time.
- Modularization of your application separates concerns and encapsulates code.
- webpack's bundles are based on a dependency graph that manages dependencies starting at an entry point.
- webpack is highly extensible and configurable.
